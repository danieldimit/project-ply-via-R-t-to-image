# Project 3D PLY object via Rotation matrix and translational vector to image
Simple project to project the corners of the 3D bounding box of an PLY object to a given image by using a rotation matrix, translation vector camera intrinsic matrix.

To run the code do:
```
python boundingBoxCalculator.py
```

The output would be a `result.png` image that would have tiny red dots on the pixels that are corners of the object bounding box.
